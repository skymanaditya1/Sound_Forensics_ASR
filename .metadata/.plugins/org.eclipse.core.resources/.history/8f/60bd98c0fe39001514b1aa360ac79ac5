 * K-Means is a clustering algorithm, 
 * Takes the set of points x1, ..., xn as input
 * Also takes the number of clusters K as input
 * Place centroids c1, ..., ck at random locations
 * For each point xi find the nearest centroid Cj, 
 * arg min D(xi, Cj), using the Euclidean distance.
 * distance (e.g Euclidian) between instance xi and cluster cj
 * assign the point xj to the cluster j.
 * For each cluster j = 1 ... K, new centroid cj = mean
 * of all points, assigned to cluster j in previous step
