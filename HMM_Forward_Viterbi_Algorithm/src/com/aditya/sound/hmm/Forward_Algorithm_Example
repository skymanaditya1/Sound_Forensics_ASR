Calculating the forward probabilities : 
The forward_probability matrix is : 
0.32000002 0.020000001 
0.046400003 0.054000005 
0.021632003 0.004632001 
The forward probability of the automaton with the given observation sequence is : 0.026264004


This basically gives the forward probability matrix and the forward path probability, which is the sum of the final state probabilities.
